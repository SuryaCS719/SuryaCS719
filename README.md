## About Me

- I'm a Computer Science graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, focused on distributed and backend systems.
- I enjoy working on problems involving reliability, scale, and coordination, especially questions about how to build systems that stay consistent and workflows that are easy to reason about.
- I tend to approach things from first principles. I question assumptions, try to simplify wherever I can, and focus on what actually needs to be solved. What matters to me is building things that work well, stay reliable, and don't fall apart when requirements change.
